      'TalentMarketplace is a curated talent pool of project professionals (project managers, coordinators, and business analysts) available for hire. After encountering the challenges that hiring project professionals face every day in $1B+ project environments, TalentMarketplace was founded as an alternative to traditional hiring practices. TalentMarketplace is not an agency - it is a software platform that provides a direct connection between project management talent that is seeking employment and employers that are looking to hire. TalentMarketplace utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically generate matches between candidates and employers. This direct, transparent hiring process increases speed to hire and decreases cost. Typical job boards take too long for both candidates and employers and do not have any filtering mechanisms. Candidates usually receive a response on about 3% of applications sent on job boards whereas on TalentMarketplace, approved candidates are over 5 times as likely to receive an interview request. Recruiters, while quick, are expensive and act as a middleman between the candidate and business reducing transparency and increasing cost. By providing direct database access, TalentMarketplace is more direct, cost effective and faster than job boards or recruiters.',
